### A lil bit of history...
Nixie Tubes were used back in the day in most displays until the world was taken over by LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes). Nixies were invented in Hungary and largely used in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. Nixies are not mass produced anymore! <br>

### Featuring our contraption...
Fret not! We have brought this relic back to life with our custom-built Nixie hardware. Our contraption can display time and also countdown from a set time. It comes with multi-color backlighting too! You can control the time, countdown, and lighting through a mobile app developed by us as well! <br>

## Description

Our Nixie clock is designed from the ground up with individual drivers for every digit (no multiplexing), Wi-Fi/BLE, built-in timekeeping, and ruggedized power supply. The custom firmware drivers allow for full dimming and/or crossfading control of the digits. Users can also customize the firmware to suit their needs. <br>

The clock is housed in a 3D printed dark grey nylon enclosure, providing a high quality feel and look. <br>

### Notable Features
- Wi-Fi/BLE for NTP sync/smart home functionality
- Dual core RISC CPU (ESP32) for complex tasks
- High accuracy RTC with TCXO to accurately keep track of time once sync'ed
- High efficiency, rugged power components to ensure long service life
- Individually addressible RGB tube illumination
- Individually driven digits which make crossfading or other such effects light on I/O as compared to multiplexed
